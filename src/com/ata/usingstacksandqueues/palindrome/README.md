# Extension Activity - Palindrome Checker

## Part 1
Implementing the `isPalindrome` method in the `PalindromeChecker` class.

Unit tests have been provided in the `PalindromeCheckerTest` class.

HINTS:
* [I need a little nudge](hints/hint-01.md)
* [I need another little nudge](hints/hint-02.md)

## Part 2
After your tests are passing, try making the `isPalindrome` method generic so that it can test for words as well!
Add a new unit test to the `PalindromeCheckerTest` class passing a `Queue` of `Character`s to the `isPalindrome`
method to validate your updates!
